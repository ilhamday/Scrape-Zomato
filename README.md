What I do to make it happens:
- Can scrap based on input categoty
- Get the data that client want
- Get the urls to move to other page
- export to csv file.
    - Add new category in csv file, don't choose number 3, because it will replace the csv file.
- give time.sleep

next, maybe:
- res{categoty}1.html <- nama file html yang didownload.
